# Gatsby v2

This starter is for Gatsby v1, check out the [beta v2 starter](https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-starter-wordpress/tree/v2).

# Gatsby WordPress Starter

A starter skeleton that leveraged the WordPress API for [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/).

### [Demo](https://gatsby-starter-wordpress.netlify.com/)

## Features

* [WordPress plugin for Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress)
* Configured to work with WordPress Advanced Custom Fields
* Auto generated Navigation for your Wordpress Pages
* Minimal UI and Styling -- highly customizable
* Styled Components

## Requirements

Your WordPress site must meet the following requirements:

* At least 1 post must have at least 1 tag
* At least 1 post must have a featured image

---

### Instructions:

Using this starter requires:

* A Wordpress acct.
* Configuring the gatsby-config.js file. You really only need to change BaseUrl, and hostingWPCOM if you're using WP.com rather than WP.org

```javascript
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-source-wordpress',
  options: {
    // The base url to your WP site.
    baseUrl: 'YOUR_WORDPRESS_URL',
    // WP.com sites set to true, WP.org set to false
    hostingWPCOM: false,
    // The protocol. This can be http or https.
    protocol: 'http',
    // Use 'Advanced Custom Fields' Wordpress plugin
    useACF: true,
    auth: {},
    // Set to true to debug endpoints on 'gatsby build'
    verboseOutput: false
  }
},
```

* Finally, you'll probably want to update the SiteConfig to match your info, because right now it has mine. ðŸ¤ 
* Suggestions:
  * Use the Prism WP Plugin to pass code blocks down.
  * If you give an ACF to a single post, you must give it to EVERY post, or GraphQL gets confused.
